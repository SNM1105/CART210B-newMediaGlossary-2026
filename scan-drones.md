## Joanna Zylinska - Scan Drones
#### By Simon Medalssy

Drones and UAVs (Unmaned Aerial Vehicles) are aircrafts that are opperated without any human pilot onboard. The earliest recorded use of drones was nearly two centuries ago. This included using weaponized balloon systems. [^imperial-war-museum]
Over time, drone technology evolved alongside GPS, digital sensor, and radio control systems, becoming central to military strategy and surveillance infrastructure. [^sighandkumar]

**Scan Drones**, although not an officially coined term, refers to UAVs equipped with imaging and sensing technologies like high resolution cameras, photogrammetric systems, and remote sensing tools.
These technologies allow drones to capture spacial data to produce mesurable digital outputs.
Unlike conventional, human photographs, which center human visual framing, scan drones use their built in cameras and sensors to capture images from above, which are then processed into detailed 3D maps.
Today, they are widely used in fields like construction, urban planning, and environmental monitoring because of the accurate and efficient ways they provide to document and measure physical spaces. [^guan-zhu-wang]
At the same time, these technologies remain central to modern warfare, where drones are used for reconaissance, targeting, and actual combat.

In the context of new media, scan drones are significant because they shift visual culture towards machine-driven image production and data extraction, linking closely to other terms like **Machine Vision**, **Non-Human Vision**, and **Automation vs Agency**, since image capturing and analysis are increasingly handled by digital systems rather than people.
They also operate within larger **data pipelines**, where captured images are processed, analyzed, and transformed into usable outputs.

As Joanna Zylinska argues in *Nonhuman Photography* (2017)[^zylinska], contemporary imaging technologies increasingly function beyond direct human perception. Photography is no longer only human vision or artistic framing.
It is becoming part of a broader technical system that observes, records, and measures the world. Scan drones are a great example of that shift. They do not just "take pictures"; they scan and map spaces.
In doing so, they reshape how environments are visualized in modern digital culture.
